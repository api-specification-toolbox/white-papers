# API Specification White Papers
This is a repository for planning the development of white papers for API specifications. This started as an idea for OpenAPI white papers, but should now be applied across all the specifications.

Possible White Papers:

- OpenAPI
- AsyncAPI
- JSON Schema
- Postman Collections
- Documentation
- Mocking
- Testing
- Security
- Monitoring
- Design
- Discovery

If you are interested in being involved in pushing one of these white papers forward you can start a GitHub issue and begin the work. We'll be using GitHub to manage the details of the work, keeping it all observable and something the community can contribute to.

We are looking for researchers, writers, editors, and sponsors for the content -- add an issue or email info@apievangelist.com for more information.
