# API Specification White Papers
This is a repository for planning the development of white papers for API specifications. This started as an idea for OpenAPI white papers, but should now be applied across all the specifications.

Possible White Papers that could be produced:

- **OpenAPI** - High level overview of the specification--meant for leadership.
- **AsyncAPI** - High level overview of the specification--meant for leadership.
- **JSON Schema** - High level overview of the specification--meant for leadership.
- **Postman Collections** - High level overview of the specification--meant for leadership.
- **Documentation** - Defining how API specifications drive documentation.
- **Mocking** - Defining how API specifications drive documentation.
- **Testing** - Defining how API specifications drive testing.
- **Security** - Defining how API specifications drive security.
- **Monitoring** - Defining how API specifications drive monitoring.
- **Design** - Defining how API specifications drive design.
- **Discovery** - Defining how API specifications drive discovery.
- **Code Generation** - Defining how API specifications drive code generation.

If you are interested in being involved in pushing one of these white papers forward you can start a GitHub issue and begin the work. We'll be using GitHub to manage the details of the work, keeping it all observable and something the community can contribute to.

We are looking for researchers, writers, editors, and sponsors for the content -- add an issue or email info@apievangelist.com for more information. This is just one of [several projects being developed as part of the API Specification Toolbox](http://api.specificationtoolbox.com/projects/).
